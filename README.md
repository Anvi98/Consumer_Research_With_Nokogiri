# Consumer_Research_With_Nokogiri
A pratical use of Nokogiri gem to research on product consumer satisfaction.
## Overview
This project is focusing on showing the use of web scraping for a digital marketing business purpose. To improve a product, most companies rely on different services or software, the implementation of scrapy here is one way on how web scraping can help achieving Consumer Research.

For this project, I targeted Revolut as the main brand.
Revolut is an English Financial Technology Company headquartered in London. You can can find out more about this company [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolut).

## Scrapy
Scrapy collects the last 20 reviews from Trustpilot, a well known platform to write a review, and display to the user a nice stat about those reviews. All in the terminal.
Finally, it saves the results into a file for further use.
